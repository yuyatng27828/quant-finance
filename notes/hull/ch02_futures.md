# ðŸ“– Chapter 2: Futures Markets and Central Counterparties

## Futures Contracts
A futures contract is a standardized agreement to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a specified date in the future.

- **Underlying assets**
  - Commodities (oil, wheat)
  - Financial instruments (bonds, interest rates)
  - Currencies
  - Stock indices

- **Standardization**
  - Quantity of the asset
  - Quality of the asset (if applicable)
  - Delivery date and location

- **Role**
  - Facilitate hedging, speculation, and arbitrage

## Participants in the Futures Market
- **Hedgers**
  - Reduce risk from price fluctuations
  - E.g. A wheat farmer selling futures to lock in a price

- **Speculators**
  - Accept risk in hopes of profit
  - E.g.Buying oil futures expecting price increase

- **Arbitrageurs**
  - Exploit price difference from theoretical fair value
  - Simultaneous buy/sell in spot and futures

## Futures Exchanges
- **Function**
  - Provide a regulated marketplace for trading

- **Major exchanges** **
  - CME Group (Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, COMEX)
  - ICE (Intercontinental Exchange)
  - Eurex

- **Trading mechanisms**
  - Open outcry = Physical floor with verbal bids and offers
  - Electronic trading = High speed online platforms

- **Price discovery**
  - Futures prices = market expectations of future spot prices

## Margin and Marking to Market
- **Purpose**
  - Reduce counterparty risk by ensuring parties can meet obligations

- **Initial margin**
  - Deposit required to open a position

- **Maintenance margin**
  - Minimum balance required to maintain a position

- **Margin call**
  - If account falls below maintenance margin, trader must deposit funds to restore margin

- **Marking to market**
  - Daily adjustment of gains/losses based on current market prices
  - Ensures gains/losses are realized immediately, reducing credit risk

## Settlement
- **Physical delivery**
  - Actual transfer of the underlying asset at contract expiration

- **Cash settlement** 
  - Payment of the difference between contract price and spot/settlement price

- **Practical note**
  - Most contracts are closed out before delivery to avoid actual delivery

## Clearinghouse / Central Counterparty (CCP)
- An intermediary between buyers and sellers

- **Functions**
  - Guarantees performance of contracts >> eliminates counterparty risk
  - Manages margin accounts and ensures daily marking to market
  - Handles defaults by liquidating positions is needed

- **Novation**
  - Original contract between buyer and seller replaced by two contracts with the CCP

- **Default management**
  - Clearinghouse closely monitors positoins and can take action if participants default

## Open Interest
- Total number of outstanding contracts not yet closed or delivered

- **Interpretation**
  - Rising open interest + rising prices = bullish sentiment
  - Falling open interest = liquidation of positions

## Price Limits and Circuit Breakers
- **Daily price limits**
  - Exchanges may cap how much a contract price and move in a day

- **Purpose**
  - Reduce extreme volatility and maintain orderly markets

- **Trading halts**
  - If limits are hit, trading may be paused temporarily

## Arbitrage and Convergence
- **Convergence**
  - Futures price approaches spot price as contract nears expiration
  - Basis = difference between spot price and futures price

- **Arbitrage opportunities**
  - Occur when futures price deviates from theoretical value
  - Based on cost-of-carry, interest rates, dividends, storage costs

## Regulatory Oversight
- Ensure transparency, reduce manipulation, maintain integrity
- E.g. In the US, CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) oversees futures markets and monitors clearinghouses
