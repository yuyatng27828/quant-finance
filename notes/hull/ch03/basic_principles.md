## 3.1 Basic Principles
A hedger uses futures contracts to reduce risk from price movements of an underlying asset (commodity, currency, index, etc.)

Perfect hedge = completely eliminates risk (rare in practice)

Common type of hedges
- Short hedge = Take a short futures position when you anticipate selling an asset in the future (to protect from price declines)
- Long hedge = Take a long futures position when you anticipate buying an asset in the future (to protect from price increases)

Hedgers need to consider
- Which contract to use
- The size of the futures position (hedge ratio)
- Whether to adjust the hedge during its life (static vs dynamic strategies)
