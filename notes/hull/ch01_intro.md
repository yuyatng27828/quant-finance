# 📖 Chapter 1: Introduction

## 🌎 OTC vs Exchange
**Exchange-traded**
  - Standardized contracts
  - Centralized clearinghouse >> low counterparty risk
  - High liquidity & transparency

**OTC (Over-the-Counter)**
  - Customized contracts
  - Direct counterparty exposure >> credit risk
  - Less transparency, more flexibility

## 🔑 Forward, Futures, and Options
**Forward**
  - OTC
  - An agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price
  
**Futures**
  - Exchange-traded forward
  
**Options**
  - OTC & exchange-traded
  - Right (not obligation) to buy/sell at strike price
  - Premium paid upfront
  - Call option = the right to buy
  - Put option = the right to sell

## ⚖️  Hedging vs Speculating vs Arbitrage
**Hedging**
  - To reduce the risk from potential future movements in a market variable
  - Futures = lock in prices, neutralize risk
  - Options = downside protection, keep upside (cost = premium)
  
**Speculating**
  - To bet on the future direction of a market variable
  - Futures = leveraged directional bets (unlimited gain/loss)
  - Options = leveraged bets with limited downside = premium
  
**Arbitrage**
  - To lock in a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions in two or more markets

## ✅ Summary
