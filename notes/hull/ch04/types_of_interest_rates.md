# 4.1 Types of Interest Rates

## Key Categories of Rates
**Treasury rates**
- Rates earned on government securities (e.g. US treasury bills, notes, bonds)- Considered risk-free (no default risk)
- Used as benchmark for other rates

**LIBOR / SOFR rates**
- Interbank lending rates = interest banks charge each other for short-term unsecured loans
- Historically LIBOR was the global standard (3-month USD LIBOR)
- Now replaced by SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)
- Reflects some credit and liquidity risk

**Repo rates (Repurchase Agreement rates)**
- Effective interest rate on borrowing cash using securities as collateral
- Repo = short-term loan where a borrower sells a secutiry and agrees to repurchase it later at a higher price
- Lower risk due to collateralization

**Risk-Free rate**
- Theoretical rate of return on an investment with zerodefault risk and no liquidity premium
- Approximated in practice by Treasury or SOFR rates
- Used as the discount rate for many derivative pricing models (e.g. Black-Scholes)

**Overnight & Interbank rates**
- Very short-term rates reflecting immediate borrowing between financial institutions
- Important for setting the short end of the yield curve

**Swap rates**
- Fixed rates exchanged for floating rates in interest rate swaps
- Reflects market expectations of future rates
- Often used as benchmarks for corporate and structured debt

## Conceptual relationships
- Treasury < Repo < LIBOR < Corporate Borrowing rate
- Increasing credit & liquidity risk

- SOFR $$\approx$$ Repo rate
- Secured, overnight, nearly risk-free
- LIBOR included credit risk, hence typically higher
