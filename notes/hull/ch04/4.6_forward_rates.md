# 4.6 Forward Rates

## What is a forward rate?
A forward rate is the implied future interest rate for borrowing/lending between two future dates, given today's zero-coupon rates.<br>
"If I were to lock in the interest rate for the period between year 1 and year 2, what rate would guarantee no-arbitrage?"

## Why do forward rates exist?
Because investors must be indifferent between: <br>
- Investing for 2 years directly
- Investing for 1 year, then reinvesting for year 2
So the forward rate makes these two strategies produce the same return &rarr; ensures no arbitrage

## Forward Rate Notation
- $$R_1$$ = 1-year zero rate
- $$R_2$$ = 2-year zero rate
- $$f_{1, 2}$$ = forward rate for the period year 1 &rarr; year 2

## Formula (annual compounding)
$$(1 + R_2)^2 = (1 + R_1)(1 + f_{1, 2})$$ <br>
$$f_{1, 2} = \frac{(1 + R_2)^2}{(1 + R_1)} - 1$$

## Formula (continuous compounding)
$$f_{1, 2} = \frac{R_2 \cdot 2 - R_1 \cdot 1}{2 - 1}$$ <br>
$$f_{a, b} = \frac{R_bb - R_aa}{b - a}$$

## Financial Intuition
- Forward rate = breakeven reinvestment rate
- If forward rate is high &rarr; market expects higher short-term rates later
- If forward rate is low &rarr; market expects lower short-term rates

## Spot vs Forward
- Spot rate = interest rate starting today
- Forward rate = interest rate starting in the future
