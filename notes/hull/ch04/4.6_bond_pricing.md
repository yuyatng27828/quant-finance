# 4.6 Bond Pricing

A bond is a fixed-income instrument representing a loan from an investor to a borrower (usually a corporation or a government). <br>
The price of a bond equals the present value (PV) of all its future cash flows, discounted at the appropriate interest rates.

## Bond Cash Flows
A coupon bond pays:
- Periodic coupons (interest payments)
- Principal (face/par value) at maturity

If:
- $$C$$ = coupon payment per period
- $$r$$ = yield per period
- $$n$$ = total number of periods
- $$M$$ = face value (usually 100 or 1000)

Then the bond price is: <br>
$$P = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\frac{C}{(1 + r)^i} + \frac{M}{(1 + r)^n}$$ <br>

Bond trades above par because coupon > market yield (investor accept a premium for higher income).

## Key Relationships
|Situation|Coupon vs Market Rate|Bond Price|Called|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Coupon = Market yield|Equal|= Par value|"At par"|
|Coupon > Market yield|Higher|> Par value|"Premium bond"|
|Coupon < Market yield|Lower|< Par value|"Discount bond"|

## Zero-Coupon Bonds
- Pay no coupons - only face value at maturity
- $$P = \frac{M}{(1 + r)^n}$$
- Used to derive zero-coupon yield curves (the foundation for valuing other bonds)

## Yield to Maturity (YTM)
- The single discount rate $$y$$ that makes the PV of all cash flows = bond's market price
- $$P = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\frac{C}{(1 + y)^i} + \frac{M}{(1 + y)^n}$$
- Solved via numerical methods (no closed form for $$y$$)
- It represents the average return per year if held to maturity and if coupons are reinvested at $$y$$

## Spot vs Yield Curve Discounting
- Using a flat yield (YTM) assumes all cash flows are discounted at the same rate
- More accurate: use the term structure (different discount rate for each maturity)
- $$P = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\frac{C}{(1 + z_i)^i} + \frac{M}{(1 + z_n)^n}$$ where $$z_i$$ = zero rate for period $$i$$

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Bond pricing = discounted cash flow problem
- Yield to maturity (YTM) is a simplification - the market really prices bonds using spot (zero) rates
- Bond price moves inversely to interest rates
- Duration and convexity measure interest rate sensitivity
