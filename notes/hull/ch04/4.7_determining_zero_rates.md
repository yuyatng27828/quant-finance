# 4.7 Determining Zero Rates

## What are Zero Rates?
- A zero rate (or spot rate) is the yield earned on a zero-coupon bond that bays no coupons - only one payment at maturity
- Each maturity (1, 2, 3 years) has its own zero rate
- These rates form the zero-coupon yield curve, which is foundational for valuing bonds and derivatives

## The Goal
We often know market prices of coupon-bearing bonds, not zero-coupon bonds directly. <br>
So we must extract (bootstrap) zero rates from these bond prices. <br>
This process is called bootstrapping.

## Bootstrapping Logic
Assume each bond's price equals the present value (PV) of its future cash flows, discounted using the appropriate zero rate for each payment date.

|Bond|Maturity|Coupon|Price||
|1-year|1 year|6%|$100|Gives $6 + $100 after 1 year|
|2-year|2 year|8%|$104|Gives $8 after 1 year, $8 + $100 after 2 years|
|3-year|3 year|10%|$109|Gives $10 after 1 year, $10 after 2 years, $10 + $100 after 3 years|

- Step 1.
  - $$100 = 106 / (1 + R_1)$$
  - $$R_1 = 6%$$

- Step 2.
  - $$104 = 8 / (1 + R_1) + 108 / (1 + R_2)^2$$
  - You already know $$R_1 = 6%$$, so you can solve for $$R_2$$

- Step 3.
  - $$109 = 10 / (1 + R_1) + 10 / (1 + R_2)^2 + 110 / (1 + R_3)^3$$
  - Use the known $$R_1$$ and $$R_2$$ to solve for $$R_3$$

This iterative approach = bootstrapping the zero curve.

## Intuition
- The shortest bond gives the shortest zero rate.
- Each sucessive bond gives one new zero rate using earlier ones.
- Once the zero curve is built, you can:
  - Price any bond or derivative
  - Compute forward rates and discount factors

## Formula Summary
If a bond's price is: <br>
$$P = \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\frac{C_i}{(1 + R_i)^{t_1}}$$ <br>
where:
- $$C_i$$ = cash flow at time $$i$$
- $$R_i$$ = zero rate corresponding to maturity $$t_i$$

## Why it matters
- The zero curve is the foundatoin for all pricing in fixed income and derivatives.
- It allows precise discounting of future cash flows without assuming a flat yield.
- Used in:
  - Bond valuation
  - Swap pricing
  - Forward rate extraction
  - Risk management
