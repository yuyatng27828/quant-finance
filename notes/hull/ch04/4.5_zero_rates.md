# 4.5 Zero Rates

## What is a Zero Rate?
A zero rate (spot rate) is the rate of interest earned on a zero-coupon investment - an instrument that pays a single cash flow at maturity and no coupons. 
It's called a zero because it has zero intermediate payments. <br>
Present Value (PV) = Future Value (FV) $$\times e^{-Rt}$$ <br>
where: <br>
- R = continuously compounded zero rate for maturity $$t$$
- $$t$$ = time to maturity in years

## Why Zero Rates Matter
Zero rates form the foundation of the yield curve - every bond, swap, and derivative is ultimately priced using discount factors derived from zero rates. <br>
They are the building blocks of:
- Discount factors
- Forward rates
- Swap rates
- Pricing of all future cash flows

## Single Cash Flow
Suppose you will receive $100 in one year and the one-year zero rate is 5% (continuous compounding): <br>
$$PV = 100 \times e^{-0.05 \times 1} = 95.12$$ <br>
✅ Interpretation: $100 in one year is worth $95.12 today. <br>
🧠 If you invest $95.12 into a market of 5%, you will have $100 in a year. Therefore, the two options (investment today or payment in a year) are equivalent. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because it can be invested to earn a return, representing an opportunity cost if received later.

## Discrete Compounding Version
If compounding is annual instead of continuous: <br>
$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+R)^t}$$ <br>
E.g. $100 in one year at 5% annual rate: <br>
$$PV = \frac{100}{1.05} = 95.24$$

## Zero Rates for Multiple Maturities
If zero rates are given for different maturities, you can construct the term structure of interest rates.

|Maturity (Years)|Zero Rate (Annual compounding)|Discount Factor|
|:---|:---|:---|
|0.5|4.0%|$$\frac{1}{1.02}$$ = 0.9804|
|1.0|4.5%|$$\frac{1}{1.045}$$ = 0.9569|
|1.5|4.8%|$$\frac{1}{1.0724}$$ = 0.9337|

Plotting zero rate vs maturity gives you the zero-coupon yield curve.

## Relationship Between Zero Rates and Bond Prices
If a coupon bond has multiple cash flows, its price is the sum of discounted future payments using the appropriate zero rates for each cash flow: <br>
$$P = \sum_{i=1}^n C_ie^{-R_it_i}$$ <br>
where:
- $$C_i$$ = cash flow at time $$t_i$$
- $$R_i$$ = zero rate for maturity $$t_i$$

## Visualization
If you graph:
- Y-axis = Zero rate (%)
- X-axis = Maturity (years)
You get the zero yield curve, which is typically upward-sloping (longer maturities have higher rates)

## Key Formulas
|Concept|Formula (Continuous compounding)|Formula (Annual compounding)|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Present value of single cash flow|$$PV = FVe^{-Rt}$$|$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+R)^t}$$|
|Discount factor|$$d(t) = e^{-Rt}$$|$$d(t) = \frac{1}{(1+R)^t}$$|
|Zero rate from discount factor|$$R = -\frac{1}{t}ln(d(y))$$|$$R = d(t)^{-1/t}-1$$|
